# LinearRegression


Implemented least squares linear regression for the housing problem.

Note: Gradient descent converges faster with increase in learning rate till learning rate is less than a threshold value. If learning rate is greater than the threshold value then gradient descent is not guarnteed to converge to a minima point.
